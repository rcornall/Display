compile on linux:
$ g++ -std=c++11 src/*cpp  -Iinc/display -o test -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system

or with cmake, go into build/ and do:
$ cmake ..
$ make
and run with ./display

you need latest SFML 2.4.2 libraries, and if using cmake, copy the FindSFML.cmake into /user/share/cmake/Modules/.
